As a reminder, in 2023, the campus community began managing COVID-19 similarly to
other infectious respiratory illnesses such as influenza and the common cold. As we
enter a season where respiratory illnesses increase, please help us engage safely
on campus, attempting to prevent the spread of illness.
1. When you are sick, please adhere to best practices in public health, such as
masking, handwashing, social distancing, and notifying any close contacts to help
reduce the spread of illness across campus.

days after diagnosis or symptoms start.
b. If you have been in contact with someone who tests positive, you should wear a
mask for 10 days after the contact.
c. If you have a fever, you should take special precautions, such as self-isolating
and masking, until you have had no fever for at least 24 hours without the use of
medications.

provider.
a. Employees should communicate with their supervisor regarding their leave request
and follow the guidance of their medical provider.
